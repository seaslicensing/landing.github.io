# University of Pennsylvania Enterprise GitHub

Penn is piloting a program to make GitHub Enterprise features available to the Penn Community.

## University of Pennsylvania GitHub Organization

Before accessing the UPenn organization on GitHub, you must have or create a GitHub account:

* [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join)

After logging into your GitHub account, access the UPenn organization dashboard via:

* https://github.com/orgs/upenn/dashboard

The first time you log into the UPenn organization via SSO, you will need to associate your PennKey login or email address with your GitHub account. You will also be required to enable [Two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication) on your GitHub account.

**WARNING:** GitHub is *not* suitable for storing sensitive information, including:

* Data subject to FERPA rules
